A painless flowchart webapp

http://ietherpad.com/flowchart

A highly biased and grossly unfair history:

### So I wanted make a simple CFG. How hard could it be to find a good online tool?

- flowchart.com requires you to sign up. If you click demo, the iframe contains a _copy_ of flowchart.com asking you to sign up.
- lucidchart.com looks like someone said "You know what the best part of Microsoft Office is? FEATURITIS!!!! Let's make a web-app based around that!"
- gliffy.com, creately.com and lovelycharts.com are all Flash-based.
    + gliffy.com is stuck on the loading screen.
    + creately.com has featuritis too, and while not as bad as lucidchart.com, the fact that the shapes you start with are People Silhouettes (Baby, Boy 1, Boy 2, Man 1-4, and Nurse) was enough to turn me off.
    + lovelycharts.com requires you to register for an account and apparently only offers paid versions
